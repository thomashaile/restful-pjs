# Project Title : TODO list API
---
TODO list API lets you search, fetch, create to-do-items and also group them together. One has to use RESTful calling style to access and edit TODO list API.The project is a single webpage containing different list items and a text area to add custom to do tasks. The “Add” button lets the user add an object to the list. We have the facility to check the items from the list or remove them if we want. If we wish, we can clear all the list items with a single button delete all. It is a very user-friendly and user-interactive project that makes the work of a user a lot easier.
